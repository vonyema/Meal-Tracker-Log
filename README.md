# Meal-Tracker
 - This app logs the food items that you've ate for the day. Search the food in the search bar and the app will generate the nutritional values of the item. Click "Add Meal" to save the item to the Meal Log.
 - I've always stuggled with counting calories and keeping track of what I've ate for the day. Creating this app will greatly improve my health and become more mindful of what I'm putting in my body.
